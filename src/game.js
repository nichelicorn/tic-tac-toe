// üó∫ CURRENT PROGRESS
// 1) can instantiate new game
//   1a) var newGame = new Game();
//       logging newGame returns the newGame object
// 2) can start a new game
//   2a) newGame.startGame();
//       logs the currentPlayer
//   2b) method can be invoked again, and a new game will start:
//       resets the currentPlayer and logs the currentPlayer

// üèÅ WHAT IS NEXT?
// ‚àö invoke startGame(); the player whose id is returned goes first
// - 6) The first player chooses a square on the board and clicks to mark the square with their token
  // what should happen in this method?
  // click happens
  // which box was clicked?
  // the box should be removed from the gameBoard
  // should the box be reassigned the currentPlayer's markedBoxes? - this doesn't exist yet; not sure yet how I will approach the checkForWin method
  // that box should be marked with the currentPlayer's token
  // replace the box id with the token?


// - 7) The token cannot be removed once placed!

    // though this would follow the logic of then checking that player's array against the WINS arrays

    // this.currentPlayer will click on a box
      // use the variables that select the boxes
      // add the box id to the playerMarkers array
      // that box will be added to their playerMarkers array??
      // (DOM) if the box is clicked, add a token to the innerText
      // (DOM) that box will display their token
  // the playerMarkers array will be cross-referenced to the currentGameBoard to discover if/when they have a win??


// Tic Tac Toe - How to play

// within the Game class, do these things:

// - 3) A row of three tokens in any direction (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) results in a win!
// - 4) A draw is also possible, and results when neither player is able to make a row of three tokens

// - 8) There will be a slight delay, then the next player is alerted to take their turn
// - 9) The next player chooses a square on the board and clicks to mark their square
// - the board might now look something like this:
// ___|_X_|___
// ___|___|___
// _O_|___|___
// - 10) NO WINS POSSIBLE AT THIS STAGE
// - 11) First player takes another turn
// - 12) Next player takes another turn
// - 13) Board now has four tokens placed
// _X_|_X_|_O_
// ___|___|___
// _O_|___|___
// - 14) NO WINS POSSIBLE AT THIS STAGE
// - 15) A win is not possible for an individual player until three of their tokens have been placed
// - 16) First player takes another turn
// - 17) Board now has 5 tokens placed, and there is a possiblity for a win!
// - 18) Evaluate location of first players tokens
// - 19) If a row of 3 has been created, alert that first player has won!
// - 20) Then add a win to first player's win count
// - Board looks like this, though:
// _X_|_X_|_O_
// ___|_X_|___
// _O_|___|___
// - 21) Next player takes another turn
// - 22) Check board again for a win. If a row of 3 has been created, alert that next player has won!
// - 23) then add a win to next player's win count
// - Board looks like this, though:
// _X_|_X_|_O_
// ___|_X_|___
// _O_|___|_O____
// - 24) First player takes another turn
// - 25) Did first player win?
// - No:
// _X_|_X_|_O_
// ___|_X_|_X_
// _O_|___|_O___
// - Next player takes a turn
// - Did next player win?
// - No:
// _X_|_X_|_O_
// _O_|_X_|_X_
// _O_|___|_O___
// - First player's turn again
// - Win?
// - 26) Yes?
// _X_|_X_|_O_
// _O_|_X_|_X_
// _O_|_X_|_O_
// - 27) Mark line through winning rainbow
// - 28) Add win to first player's win count
// - 29) Delay, then wipe the board and restart with next player going First
// - OR
// - 29) Have a popup that asks if you want to play again


// setup:
// - 1) ‚àö Two players, each has a different token
//   - ex: first player, token = X; next player, token = O
// - 2) ‚àö One game board: a grid of nine squares, three high by three wide
// ‚àö game should have two players
// ‚àö game should have an empty game board at the start of the Game
// - 5) ‚àö The game begins by randomly selecting the first player
// whose turn is it? should that be in the constructor, or in a separate method?
