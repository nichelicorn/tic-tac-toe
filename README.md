# ‚ùå Tic Tac Toe! ‚≠ïÔ∏è
#### Let's play Tic Tac Toe!

#### Overview & [Project](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/module-1/tic-tac-toe-solo.html) Goals
- Now that you‚Äôve got the main foundations down to build out a frontend application, it‚Äôs time to prove to yourself that you own those skills! You‚Äôre going to be building a Tic Tac Toe game from scratch!

#### Learning Goals
- My learning goal for this project was to fully implement the concepts introduced in Mod 1 and create a working Tic Tac Toe game.
- My secondary goal was to jump into CSS animations, time permitting.

#### Why was this project created?
- DRY JavaScript
- localStorage to persist data
- event delegation to handle similar event listeners
- Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
- Iterate through/filter DOM elements using for loops
- Use your problem solving process to break down large problems, solve things step by step, and trust yourself to not rely on an outside ‚Äúanswer‚Äù to a logical challenge

#### How does this work?
- Tic Tac Toe is a two-player game. First, decide who will be X's, and who will be O's. Then click the button and start playing!
- When the start button is clicked, it will randomly decide who goes first.
- The first player chooses a square and clicks to mark the square with their token.
- The next player is alerted to take a turn! Once the second player chooses a square, they will click to mark the square with their token.
- If a player creates a row of three tokens in any direction, they win the game! A notification will appear before automatically resetting the game board.

#### Technologies Used
- [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/javascript)
- [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)
- [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)

#### Project Reflection
- Overall, this project went really well! My previous project experiences in this Mod gave me some good tools when planning this project.
- I started out with ProCreate, drawing out my wireframe, and outlining the steps to play tic tac toe. I really enjoyed using this tool in the planning process, and it helped me work out some logic challenges that came up during creation of the game logic.

##### Wins
- I'm proud of my tic tac toe game! I was able to work through each JavaScript file separately, and found that exercise helpful in understanding how the code can work together, and why each Class is kept separately.
- I didn't make exceptionally quick progress, but felt that I was keeping a steady pace. Because I had extensively planned and pseudocoded, I was able to have several long breaks in my days. The time away from my desk meant that I was more productive when I did sit down to work.

##### Challenges
- I would have liked to have more time to dive into some CSS challenges.
- There are two very long reset conditionals at the end of main.js that I would like to refactor. Solving the problem of preventing duplicate clicks was more challenging to solve, and I made a choice not to refactor this portion of the code, given the stage in the project phase.

##### Overall Impressions
- It went really well! I had a lot of fun planning out the project, and found that the JavaScript was actually more interesting to me than working on the CSS. This project has given me inspiration to continue building games to practice logic and class interactions within JavaScript.
- I got some good practice with project planning and pseudocoding, and will continue to work on those skills.

#### Future Features
- CSS fun!
- Work on an Ahsoka/Anakin theme
